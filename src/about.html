					<h1> Hi! My name is Larissa and I am a yoga teacher in North Wales and Chester area.</h1>
					<p>I became a yoga teacher because I want to share my passion and enthusiasm for the practice with other people and I want to share all the benefits that I have received with others. I strongly believe in the healing benefits of yoga.   </p>

					<p>I understand that it is a challenge to be a teacher leading students through class, helping people with gaining back their flexibility and fitness. I would like to support and encourage my students to train their concentration, balance and body-control. And this is so rewarding!</p>

					
					<p>I decided to make a change when I went to the local clinic for acupuncture and the therapist there was very calm and relaxed and I could see that he really enjoyed his job. So I made a first step towards a more relaxed me and enrolled on a course "Introduction to Holistic Therapies". I enjoyed it so much that "Indian Head Massage" coure followed very shortly. I thought it would be amazing to make others feel better.</p>

					<p>All this led to my first yoga class and it was the best decision I have ever made. I fell completely in love with Yoga. I was happier and in better harmony with the people around me I am now physically fit and have ever felt better about my body. However, the biggest change has been spiritual and intellectual.</p>

					<p>I began my studies with <a href="http://www.bwy.org.uk/">British Wheel of Yoga</a> in 2009 and received Diploma of  "Qualified  Yoga Teacher" in 2012. I have been teaching for more than 5 years in Chester and North Wales area. I never stop learning and enjoy attending various workshops in UK and abroad. 

					<p>In 2010 I attended 2 day workshop by David Swenson. And in 2012 I attended another intensive course of "Vinyasa Krama Yoga" with Srivatsa Ramaswami the longest standing student of the legendary Shri T. Krishnamacharya "the father of modern yoga” and teacher of T.K.V. Desikachar, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indra_Devi">Indra Devi</a>, his brother-in-law  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.K.S._Iyengar">B.K.S.
